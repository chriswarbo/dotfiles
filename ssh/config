# We want access to warbo@github.com and chriswarbo@github.com, but
# GitHub don't let us specify the username: it's always git@github.com,
# and we're identified by our SSH key. This means we need to send a
# different key depending on which user we're trying to be.
# Let's use chriswarbo for the default github.com (so accessing ZipAbout
# repos is easiest), and make an alias for warbo for those few times we
# need such access.
