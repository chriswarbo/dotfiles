Subject: Encapsulate Haskell helpers once their users are Haskell
Message-Id: <a34e636930623530-0-artemis@chriss-mbp.lan>

We're exposing some Haskell commands in shortcuts.nix which should ideally be
internal helpers, rather than actual commands. Once we've ported their users
from bash into Haskell, we can stop exposing them.
