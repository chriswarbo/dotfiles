Subject: Karabiner: Map menu key on Natural keyboard to Fn
Message-Id: <9c856bd7db8d5c3b-0-artemis@MacBook-Pro.local>

Pressing F1, F2, etc. doesn't work on Microsoft Natural keyboard. It works if we
hold down the Fn key on the mac keyboard (bottom left). Hence we should remap a
key on the Natural keyboard to fulfil this role. I think the menu key (next to
Alt Gr) should do the trick.
